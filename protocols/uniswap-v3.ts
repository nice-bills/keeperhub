const SQRT_PRICE_LIMIT_TIP =

To swap native ETH directly, set this to the chain's WETH address and provide the swap amount via the 'ETH Value' field below - SwapRouter02 will wrap msg.value internally and no token approval is needed.

Get Position Details' Tokens Owed fields only update when a position is touched, so they leave out fees earned since - do not use them to decide whether there is anything to collect.";

const DECREASE_LIQUIDITY_TIP =
  "How much of the position's liquidity to remove, in liquidity units - read the current total from Get Position Details' Liquidity output. The removed tokens are credited to the position, not sent anywhere: follow this step with Collect Fees to withdraw them. Removing all liquidity and collecting is what makes a position burnable.";

const MIN_AMOUNT_TIP =

const COLLECT_RECIPIENT_TIP =

// Two deliberate divergences from upstream mutability in this file.
//
// QuoterV2: upstream the quote functions are `nonpayable` (they use a revert-
// as-return idiom: pool.swap is invoked inside try/catch and the simulated
// amounts are decoded from the revert data), but every client invokes them
// via eth_call. Marking them `view` here classifies the action as a read
// step (no credentials, no gas, no transaction). Solidity's mutability model
// cannot express "off-chain simulation"; this is the cleanest place to bridge
// that gap until AbiFunctionOverride supports a stateMutability override.
//
// NonfungiblePositionManager collect / decreaseLiquidity / increaseLiquidity:
// upstream they are `payable` only so they can be batched inside `multicall`
// alongside a WETH wrap or `refundETH`. Called directly, as these actions do,
// any ETH sent stays in the position manager, and its public `refundETH()`
// pays the whole balance to whoever calls it next. A `payable` ABI would show
// an ETH Value field whose every non-zero use hands that ETH to a stranger, so
// these three are declared `nonpayable` here. Mutability does not enter the
// selector or the encoding; the calldata is identical.
//
// `burn` carries the same hazard but stays `payable`, matching upstream and
// the shipped action. Narrowing it would break callers that exist today: an
// API caller posting `ethValue` to burn-position would be refused outright,
// and a saved node carrying one would have it dropped silently. The hazard is
// a value-level concern, not a mutability one - the place to refuse a non-zero
// ethValue on burn is lib/protocol-input-guards.ts, where a message can say
// why.
