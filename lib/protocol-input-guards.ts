/**
 * Value-level guards for protocol action inputs.
 *
 * The registry validates an input's shape (a 20-byte address, a uint) but not
 * whether a particular value is safe for a particular function. Some contracts
 * treat a shape-valid value as a sentinel that redirects funds, and the ABI
 * cannot express that. Those rules live here, keyed by protocol and function,
 * so both paths that build protocol call arguments enforce the same thing:
 * the workflow write step (plugins/protocol/steps/protocol-write.ts) and the
 * direct-execute route (app/api/execute/_lib/protocol-function-args.ts).
 *
 * Keep the list short. A guard belongs here only when a shape-valid value
 * loses funds or silently does something other than what the field says.
