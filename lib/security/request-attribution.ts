 * client IP because our prod ingress terminates at CF and CF strips any
 * client-supplied value. If the header is absent (local dev, internal

 * strict superset. TriggerType is the Prometheus-label vocabulary for the
 * `keeperhub_workflow_executions_started_total` metric and contains
 * (manual | webhook | scheduled | schedule | block | event). TriggerSource
 * adds `mcp` and `internal` to distinguish auth paths the metric label set
 * intentionally conflates -- a workflow with a manual trigger node can be
 * invoked via the MCP marketplace path OR a direct API call, and the
 * security attribution column wants to tell them apart even though both
 * report `manual` to Prometheus.
 *
 * If a new value is added here that doesn't also belong in TriggerType,
 * the `triggerType as TriggerSource` cast in
 * `app/api/workflow/[workflowId]/execute/route.ts` will be unsound. Keep
 * the cast direction (TriggerType -> TriggerSource) and add new values
 * to whichever union actually needs them; do not invert.
