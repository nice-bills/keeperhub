/**
 * Platform default value caps, applied whenever an organization has not
 * configured a cap of its own.
 *
 * Before these existed, a missing `organization_spend_caps` row -- or a null
 * column for one chain family -- meant unlimited. Only an admin visiting the
 * spend-cap UI ever created a row, so every organization was unlimited by
 * default and a leaked API key was bounded only by the wallet balance. The
 * caps below are the fail-closed floor: an organization must raise its own
 * ceiling deliberately rather than inherit an unbounded one.
 *
 * The two native figures are denominated in the native asset, NOT in USD, so
 * their USD worth drifts with the market: if ETH doubles, the real ceiling
 * doubles with it and nothing alerts. A Chainlink native/USD read does exist in
 * this codebase (`getNativeUsdPrice` in lib/safe/price-oracle.ts, 60s cached,
 * used pre-broadcast by the Safe simulate routes), but the reservation runs
 * inside a `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` transaction and neither reservation entry
 * point carries a chain id -- `reserveOrgValue` has none at all -- so pricing
 * here would mean holding a row lock across an RPC round trip on a path that
 * has no chain to price. The figures are therefore fixed, chosen at the
 * reference price stated on each, and the drift is accepted deliberately.
 *
 * Each default is overridable from the environment, and both values.yaml files
 * set it explicitly for the app and the executor, so widening one that is
 * binding a live integrator is a values edit and a release rather than a code
 * change. It is not instant: `type: kv` means the new figure ships with a helm
 * upgrade. Anything faster would need the key moved to parameterStore, where a
 * value change plus a pod restart is enough.
 *
 * (`AGENTIC_WALLET_DAILY_CAP_MICROS` makes the same "tune without a deploy"
 * claim and is wired into neither environment, so it is not the precedent it
 * appears to be.)

// The reference ceiling these are chosen against is the 200 USD/day figure

// the one ratified spend-policy number in the codebase. Each default below
// sits at or under it deliberately: a default that binds too tightly is a
// values.yaml edit, while one that binds too loosely is an unbounded outflow
// nobody notices. The rollout
// widens from here on evidence (watch spend_cap_default_applied), rather than
// starting wide and tightening after an incident.

// 0.02 ETH, about 80 USD at a 4,000 USD/ETH reference price.

// Denominated in ETH, not USD, so the realized ceiling moves with the market.
// The figure is picked so that drift cannot carry it above the 200 USD anchor
// until ETH passes roughly 10,000 USD -- the upward direction is the dangerous
// one, because nothing alerts when a cap silently widens. Applies to every EVM
// chain, testnets included, because the ledger column it is compared against is
// chain-agnostic.

// much as its removal. The two figures do different jobs: the per-call ceiling
